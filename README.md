I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on meaningful projects. If you're working on something interesting, feel free to reach out.

📷 I shoot with a **Sony mirrorless camera** and a **Sony FE 35mm f/1.4 GM Lens**, capturing high-quality photography across various settings.

When I’m not coding, I am either studying, doing freelance photography or editing, creating digital or traditional art, or playing a game.
